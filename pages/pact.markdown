# The Yellowstone Pact #

## As Above, So Below: How We Maintain Equilibrium ##

(This is a living document and will be amended as needed.)

We’re all responsible for the caretaking of the community.
 
- Be kind to one another. Extend the benefit of the doubt. Avoid escalating arguments. Share the space and do your best to keep the atmosphere comfortable and welcoming. If you’re confused about something, ask for clarification - it’s far more likely that there’s a misunderstanding rather than malice! If a discussion is going in circles, or someone asks to stop, let it drop. Avoid discussing potentially contentious topics - these include any topic that should only be discussed in a way that affords it the sober respect it deserves. If you’re unsure, ask! We believe in the good faith participation of everyone in the community, and that goes for honest mistakes too. If it helps, remember that Yellowstone is a National Park! If you see litter, help clean it up, so that we can maintain a healthy environment for everyone.

- We’re committed to allowing everyone the space to express themselves while remaining consistent with what the Groundskeepers expect our spaces to be.

- This is an official Discord-based social place for participation in the cultural event of Blaseball, and Blaseball is full of ups and downs. The downs can be especially tough to handle when it involves the loss of a beloved player, but even the small disappointments can be tiring when they keep piling up. That means we must strive to be respectful of each other as we experience disappointments, but at the same time abide by guideline #1 and allow others to keep participating comfortably. It’s a tricky balance to find, and we’re doing our best! If you feel that you aren’t being given the space to be heard, you can DM a Wayfinder, an Archranger, or a Keeper, and they will listen and help you find a solution.

- We are required to respect each others’ personal interpretation of Blaseball canon and recognize that no one is beholden to anyone else’s vision.

- Community collaboration on Blaseball strategy and fanwork is a major part of Blaseball, but there is not and will never be a complete consensus on anything. You are actively encouraged to interpret Blaseball canon and events however you like - just be sure to afford everyone else the same freedom and respect! The same goes for our voting strategies: we may decide what we want to see and thus coordinate to try to make it a reality, but it is not binding and you are free to follow your heart and vote as you wish. Assuming good faith goes for votes, too!

- We expect each and every one of us to take responsibility for our own actions and the effect they have on our teammates.

- Conflict is inevitable when you have so many different people together in the same space. Even if you’re doing your best to abide by the server’s conduct code, you can misspeak and cause unintended harm. Apologize when you’ve hurt someone, and resist the very natural human urge to explain yourself as part of your apology; this doesn’t help as much as it feels it does, and it’s better to keep the focus on your apology for your actions. Disagreements happen, but they don’t have to escalate, and we can all do our part. Be willing to take a step back if you need it: this takes care of you and your teammates. Even Blaseball takes a siesta sometimes.

-As a refresher on the server’s conduct code, bigotry has no place in blaseball. Racism, sexism, xenophobia, transphobia, homophobia, misogyny, ableism, hate symbols, and any other expression of hateful conduct, harassment, or microaggression targeted at individuals or identities are not permitted anywhere in the Blaseball Discord server. A mistaken use of a term that has fallen out of favor is one thing and we will educate in good faith, but actions made in bad faith will be recognized by the community, and handled by the Keepers.

**An abbreviated summary of the Pact’s conduct code can be posted in any of Magic’s team channels by using the command +pact.**

## ROLES OF NOTE ##

### WAYFINDERS: ###

Wayfinders are Magic volunteers who help keep the chat a space where everyone feels welcome to take part in our conversations. If any tense discussions are occurring, Wayfinders will pop up to ask if anyone is feeling uncomfortable, and if so, they will guide the conversation back to more welcoming territory. Wayfinders often signify themselves with a compass emoji (🧭, :compass:) in their display name, in order to be easily identified.

If you ever think the chat needs a Wayfinder and you're willing, you can take on the role yourself! There is no application or approval process, you simply become a Wayfinder when you decide to do what a Wayfinder does. We’ve put together some notes below on what you’re volunteering for, and an explanation on how to conduct a Wayfinder check.
As a Wayfinder PLEASE:

- Respond to a pause button reply by encouraging the chat to take a brief pause
- Help start a new topic if you get a SINGLE X in reply to your check-in message
- Respect the privacy of anyone that messages you for assistance
- Steer uncomfortable conversation back to solid ground
- If the situation involves a case of ongoing friction between two people, rather than a one-off conflict, pass the issue off to a Keeper - they’re better equipped to handle interpersonal problems
- Contact the Keepers via DM or modmail if you have concerns about a situation that they should hear, with a link to the start of the conflict if possible
- If you aren’t feeling up to the responsibilities of the role, either on a temporary basis or longer term, you can step down for as long as you need by simply removing the emoji from your display name. Your work is appreciated, but your self-care comes first!


If you feel like we could use a check-in on a current topic, type a message that includes the words wayfinder check in the chat, preferably with an explanation of what you’re checking. For example: “Wayfinder check, are we okay to keep talking about giant spiders?” - which makes it clear that a ✅ check mark means “yes I’m good,” a ⏸️ pause button means “I have concerns to explain,” and a ❌ red x means “no I’m not good, I need a topic change.”


Wayfinder checks can be done by anyone who feels we need it! Wayfinders have committed to keeping an eye out for the situations that may call for it, but if you feel it is needed and are comfortable doing so, please start a Wayfinder check yourself!.

### STARFINDERS: ###

Starfinders are specialized Wayfinders whose primary channel focus is #starpark, our channel for discussing election strategy and player statistics (among related topics). Starfinders can operate in any channel, but their responsibility is most likely to come up in #starpark. Their unique responsibility is answering questions that request information. These questions are denoted by a star emoji (⭐ :star:). For example: “⭐ Blessing A sounds really good to me, but I don’t see people talking about it, why is that?” A Starfinder reacts to that question with the telescope emoji (🔭 :telescope:) to “tag” that question and indicate that they’re working on an informative answer. In the previous example, an answer might be “🔭 Blessing A boosts Stat X, and our players are already pretty solid in that stat. It wouldn’t hurt us, but it wouldn’t help us a whole lot, and we’ve heard that several other teams really want it so there’d be high competition.” A Starfinder’s[a] response needs to be as clear as possible, and avoid giving personal opinions in response to a starred question. This does not mean that Starfinders are banned from sharing their opinions! However, when a Starfinder directly answers starred questions with a telescope answer, they’re indicating that they’re trying to help someone else join the conversation by giving them what they need to get started and get comfortable.


The secondary responsibility of Starfinders is the basic Wayfinder responsibility: keep tabs on the vibes around channel discussions, and help guide the conversation away from tense topics. If a Starfinder senses that the current topic of discussion is getting a little heated, they’ll initiate a Wayfinder check, and follow through on introducing a new topic if the check indicates it’s needed. Like Wayfinders, Starfinders are a volunteer role with no application or approval process; if you want to be a Starfinder, you can put the emoji in your display name and go from there!

### ARCHRANGERS: ###

Archrangers are the Magic’s team representatives, and act as facilitators of the Magic’s spaces within the Discord server. They are not moderators and they are not authority figures; they’re more like Wayfinders with additional responsibilities and a few extra Discord powers. Archrangers facilitate the team in making team-wide decisions, rather than make the decisions themselves. They organize our process of creating lore, coordinate polls for finalizing decisions, act as ambassadors to other teams, and stay on top of updates to the team’s wiki entries. Nearly everything an Archranger does can also be done by any other member of the Magic, aside from things that require Discord permissions (specifically: pinning ability, and access to all-team representatives channels for easy cross-team communication). Archrangers are fellow fans, and they are fallible. If you aren’t confident in the actions of an Archranger, you are strongly encouraged to reach out to a Keeper to share your concerns.

### GROUNDSKEEPERS: ###

The Groundskeepers, or Keepers, are the moderators of the Discord server. They have the responsibility of keeping the server tidy, free of trash, and ready for use, which is why they share their title with the people who maintain sports fields. Keepers handle all issues requiring moderation, like violations of server rules, conflict in the channels, and acts of harassment. They also take care of things like channel name changes and tweaks to channel slow modes. If you see a Keeper show up in our channels, don’t assume that something is wrong! They like to hang out too, and we’ve been told that a lot of Keepers really appreciate Magic’s mossy vibes! There are currently two Keepers who were previously members of Magic, keeper_owl and keeper_penny.

If you need to contact a Keeper about something happening in the Discord server, you have several options, but the most recommended is to DM the MODMAIL_KEEPERS bot, which will alert all currently online keepers. You can also ping @groundskeepers, or DM an online Keeper directly. Anyone can contact the Keepers! It isn’t an ability limited to the Archrangers or other team reps, and Keepers would prefer to respond to a false alarm than for a concern to go unaddressed.

### STRATEGY SQUAD: ###

The Magic’s Strategy Squad is a group of stats-minded volunteers who are very good at number-crunching and mathemagics. They examine the various decrees, blessings, wills, and anything else upcoming in the Sunday elections, take the pulse of the team as a whole via preference polls and observing the chat, and do some arcane numeromancy to distill all the information down into an easy-to-follow guide. Their considerations are wide-ranging, encompassing not only what could give us raw stat-based boosts, but also what suits us lore-wise and culture-wise (such as blessings named for magical or outdoorsy things) as well as which blessings may be heavily contested by other teams, and what the team is saying when discussing elections in team chat.

The squad is dedicated to producing the guide well ahead of elections, usually by Midseason, but the exact timing depends a lot on the complexity of the information they need to process. Please note, the voting recommendation guide is non-binding and it is absolutely okay to vote against what the guide says; this is what we mean by vote with your heart! The guide is there for people seeking guidance on how to coordinate their votes and give us better chances at an outcome that the squad feels could benefit the team. Also, best practice will always be to wait as late as possible before casting your votes, as late-season developments could totally upend our previous strategies!

## GUIDELINES FOR PARTICIPATION ##

There are more than 35,000 members of the Discord server, and more than 1,500 of them have indicated that their chosen team is the Magic! Of course, not all of them are actively participating in the server, but it still means the Magic is one of the largest teams on Discord, and that can be important to remember when you post in our channels. Blaseball can be very emotionally charged, especially because all of us are invested in what we’re doing here, and sometimes that can make things a little bit tense. The following guidelines are intended to help you navigate the chat especially in cases when the tension is rising, but they’re also good guidelines for all situations.

## THINGS TO CONSIDER BEFORE YOU POST: ##

- Do you know what everyone wants out of the discussion? Are you sure you understand what someone is trying to say?
- Is the conversation fun? Is it productive? Is it on-topic?
- Does the person you're talking with want to continue the discussion right now? Are you willing to drop the subject if asked?
- Do you like what you’re about to say? Is it something you’d be proud to contribute to the community?


### THE PAUSE BUTTON: ###

We utilize the Pause button emoji (⏸️, :pause_button:) as an important chat signal. It can mean several things, like “please give me time to type up my thoughts,” or “there’s a lot of messages happening, we should pause to read them over and react to ones we agree with so that people know that they’re being heard.” In all cases, it means “hold on, let me say something.” If you see someone use the pause, stop typing and wait for them to explain, and don’t start typing again until they say that they’re done and that we’re “unpaused.” 

If you were in the middle of typing, the person who called for a pause may specifically invite you to continue, but if not, transfer your typing to a notes app, and if that doesn’t work, you can DM any active Archranger and ask them to “hold your thought” for you by posting it there in the DM. Continuing to type when a pause is called is something we discourage, because for a lot of us it just looks pretty rude to see “Several people are typing…” after someone asked for a pause. If you feel like you need it, please use the pause yourself, and let us know what’s going on that made you call for it. Because this is an important tool, it needs to be utilized properly to stay effective. We have a Carl chatbot command that shares this information in Magic’s channels, which you can bring up with the command +pausebutton.

### THINGS TO CONSIDER BEFORE YOU PAUSE: ###

- Are messages coming in big blocks? Are several people typing?

- Is the current conversation an important community discussion? Should everyone be able to participate comfortably if they want to?

- Is the speed of the conversation making participation difficult? Are several participants’ messages going unacknowledged?

- Are there signs that others are feeling overwhelmed? Are you?

- Do you feel good about continuing the conversation after the pause? Would you feel better if you took a personal break instead?

### ON COMMUNICATING TONE CLEARLY IN TEXT: ###

It can be very difficult to indicate tone in a text-based conversation. If you are unsure how someone intended their words to come across, or they seem abrasive, ask them to clarify, and assume that they mean well unless proven otherwise. It is better to ask for clarification and resolve misunderstandings before an argument starts.

For jokes/statements that may be easily misconstrued, consider making it clear if you are serious or not. Some people do this using tags at the end of messages, such as:

    /j = joking
    /hj = half joking
    /s = sarcasm
    /srs = serious
    /lh = lighthearted
    /rh = rhetorical question
    /pos = positive connotation
    /gen = genuine question or statement

You are not required to use these tags, but they can go a long way toward clearing up a potential misunderstanding in advance.

Spoiler text ||like this|| is usually used for reasons of hiding Forbidden Knowledge (deep game secrets that are treated as opt-in information), or a content warning for something under the spoiler text. We discourage the use of spoiler text markup for the use of jokes without clearly indicating outside the hidden spoiler that it is a joke, which is where some of these tags can come in handy.

### ON SHIPPING AND YELLOWSTONE’S LANDLOCKED STATUS: ###

Early on, the members of Magic came to an agreement that as a team we would prefer not to become involved in shipping. For the unfamiliar, shipping is a common fandom activity centered on connecting two or more characters into a relationship, usually implied to be romantic (but not always). Shipping comes with a heavy history of conflict in fandom spaces, with supporters of different ships clashing over their preferred canon. Early Magic decided we would rather not set ourselves up for potential arguments over what ships are our team's “canon,” and decided to leave that aspect to individual headcanons. As a result, we became a team that does not include romantic relationships as part of our characters’ lore.

A fancomic commented on this by having a character respond to the lack of shipping in Yellowstone with the response “We’re landlocked.” It quickly caught on for our stance on ships. It’s a play on the fact that Yellowstone is in the interior of the continent with no ocean coastline, combined with the fact that most cargo shipping is done across oceans. It’s simply a joking term to sum up our “no official ships” policy.

When we host other teams for lorejams involving one of their characters that has come to our team, and the other team had that character involved in a relationship, we respect that character development and the comfort of the team by putting all discussion of shipping behind ||spoiler tags||  so that everyone can find a way to be involved in the conversation. This only applies to crossteam lore jams when a relationship is an important part of the character’s past with their previous team; at all other times our landlocked policy prevails. Fanworks involving Magic players in relationships, like fanfic and fanart, can still be shared, as long as we don’t engage in discussing ships in our channels.

### ON INVOLVEMENT, FOMO, AND GETTING CAUGHT UP: ###

Blaseball is an engrossing cultural event, with games on the hour every hour for most of a given season. Big things can and will happen when you're not around. As excited as everyone is to leave a piece of themselves in the game by being part of big things, like helping to shape a new player's identity, we have to temper that excitement with the reality that Blaseball happens so much and there will be other opportunities. When we collaborate, what gets put together is what we collectively feel fits best together. Not every idea can be incorporated, and there will be finalized projects that you disagree with or don’t get a chance to contribute to. This can lead to disappointment, and that disappointment can hit surprisingly hard.

FOMO (fear of missing out) is very likely to happen when events occur at such a fast pace. Even the idea of being absent from the Discord chat when a big event happens can invoke that feeling of FOMO. Remember that the Pact asks for you to find the balance between being honest about your negativity and maintaining a welcome space for others, and do your best to find that balance with as little impact on your teammates as possible. Additionally, you might be around when someone peeks in for the first time in a while. They’ve probably missed a lot, and it can be tough to catch up. Welcome them back, remind them to check the pins, and help them get up to speed!

### ON TEAM REPRESENTATION AND INTERACTING WITH OTHER FANS: ###

The Magic shares Blaseball with many other distinct team communities, each with their own quirks and cultures. We consider all other teams to be our friends, and our behavior should back that up. How you conduct yourself in other channels reflects on our team’s identity and reputation. Be kind and respectful. Heed the rules regarding friendly competition and where to draw the line before it becomes antagonizing. Understand that other fans aren’t responsible for what happens in the game and that their team is also made of many voices with many visions. If someone in a general channel is frustrating you, don’t use the Magic channels to complain about them or their team. We have an open-visit policy; we do ask our visitors to say Hi when they enter, but this means you should conduct yourself as if what you say in our channel could be seen by any other team’s fans - because it can. 

Sometimes we host gatherings that invite other teams into our channels, or get invited to their channels for a special event. If you want to join in, be a good host and/or guest! And don’t be afraid to go visit other teams on your own to socialize, learn their perspectives, or even consider a team hop! There are resources available in #rules, #choose-your-team, and the channel pins regarding how to do it and how to find out which teams are open to visitors. The latter is very important: make sure that a team is not closed to visitors before you drop in!

### ON ELECTION INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER TEAMS: ###

We are a team that believes very much in working together against the struggles the sim throws at us. That said, we heavily discourage attempting to coordinate our team strategies with other teams before the Strategy Squad’s guide is produced. Putting out feelers to other teams too early can lead to confusion about our plans if (and when) things change. This is also true for idol board shenanigans and other league-wide actions. We love to work together across the league, but acting too quickly can be more disruptive than helpful!

If you do want to get involved in a league-wide action that the team as a whole hasn’t committed to, make sure to make it clear that you are acting on your own, if anyone else asks. Things like idol board manipulation can have multiple plans at odds with each other, and different members of the team may back different plans, so you can help avoid confusion about what Magic as a whole is doing, which reduces stress for everyone involved.

## REMEMBER: WE ARE ALL LOVE BLASEBALL ##

### SELF CARE STATEMENT ##

The pace of Blaseball can be overwhelming, in both game events and Discord activity. Be aware of your limits and what you need for your own well-being, and watch for signs of burnout. Emotions can run high, especially after weather events, playoffs, and elections. Please take care of yourself! We are a strong community of well meaning individuals, and we value what we’ve made under the name of the Yellowstone Magic. However, it's important to note that we are not mental health professionals, and if you're struggling, we encourage you to reach out to a resource with the skills to help you.

If things are feeling overwhelming, take a break! Close Discord, close your browser tab, disengage for a bit! Blaseball will still be here, and by taking care of your own emotional state, you also help take care of your teammates. If you need help disengaging, the Keepers have tools available to help you step back and take a breather! This can include placing a short-term mute on your account, to reinforce your decision to take a break. This would not be punishment, just Keepers using the tools they have to help you step back for a little while. To reach the Keepers privately, you can either DM the MODMAIL_KEEPERS bot, or DM any online and available Keeper.

Of all the community accords in the Pact, these are the most important of all, and require the most ongoing attention to make sure we’re all upholding them to the best of our abilities. By pledging to respect what each of us brings to our shared space, we continue to grow this incredible mossy community that is the Yellowstone Magic.✨

## SOME MAGIC FAQs ##

Q: What’s with the finger-pointing-up 👆 and finger-pointing-down 👇 emojis? Are people upvoting and downvoting my message?
        A: What you are seeing are Magic’s “uppy-downies,” our emoji reacts for strong agreement, and also anything related to Magic vibes. They correspond to our team motto, “As Above, So Below,” and they aren’t people upvoting or downvoting you! Not only does the use of two emojis express our motto, the act of keeping the react numbers even across the two emojis is a ritual of maintaining balance. In other words, we like the numbers to be the same!

Q: What’s ASSA BEEB ABBA SOOS?

A: Short answer: it’s what happens when you deepfry “As Above So Below.” Longer answer: a late night conversation about our motto turned into an attempt to expand the concept even further and make the motto look even more balanced and symmetrical, and “ASSA BEEB ABBA SOOS” was deemed close enough to that goal. It means essentially the same thing, just a bit more lighthearted!

Q: What’s all these references to moss about?

        A: For a significant stretch of seasons, Magic did not win any blessings. Other teams around us were winning and improving, yet we were stagnant or even declining. It was really disheartening! Finally it got to a point where someone said they wanted to just lie down and become moss. This idea spread, as moss does, and has now become a major part of the Magic identity. Mossiness means maintaining the reputation of the Magic as a chill and considerate community where everyone is welcome to come into our channels and stay a while. Mossiness means active participation in community stewardship and dedication to the good vibes that your fellow fans have established. Mossiness means leaving the community better than you found it. This is what we mean when we say “stay mossy!”

Q: What’s Magic Goo?
        A: Magic Goo! When we won the blessing 0 No, which gave the team 0 No blood, at first we didn’t know what it did. The modification icon only said “Players with 0 No blood are Good.” It wasn’t until the following season began that we learned its true effects (players cannot be struck out unless there is at least 1 ball in the count), but the fact that we were “canonically good” was a bit of a rallying cry. Then a typo happened, and because this is the internet, that typo was pounced on. So now you say “Magic Good!” simply by dropping the last letter.

Q: What’s “bluesky” and why do people put it in spoiler text?

A: “bluesky” is a piece of community lore, expanding on the concept of As Above, So Below. If Yellowstone is the Below, then is the blue sky Above also a park? We have a fan-created organization similar to the SCP Foundation that catalogs paranormal phenomena in Yellowstone, including the entire concept of “bluesky” as a weird inverted alternate park existing above Yellowstone. Also like the SCP Foundation, a lot of information in these reports is redacted. In our chat channels, people keep up the theme by hiding all mentions of bluesky in spoiler text so that it remains “redacted information.” It’s only an in-joke reference to that lore! Because it’s just a joke, it is not required to hide all mentions of bluesky, and people can choose not to--it’s just for fun!
