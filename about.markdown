This is an official(?) wobsite for the Yellowstone Magic Blaseball fans!

It is currently maintained by trucy via the Yellowstone Magic repository:

## How to write a Post™

If you know your way around [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) you can directly make a pull request.

If you don’t, honestly, feel free to send it to me (trucy) via discord DM!
If you want to be 𝓯𝓪𝓷𝓬𝔂 with some emphasis and such it’s basically the same
as discord (Markdown), but just in case, here’s this handy cheat sheet:

And I’d be glad to help you!

Please feel free to contribute!
