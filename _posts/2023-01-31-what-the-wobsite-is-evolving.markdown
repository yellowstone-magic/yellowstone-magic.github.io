It‚Äôs been a week, huh? After Magic getting in the postseason, playing against
the Boston Flowers from the‚Ä¶ Chaotic Good league? We missed an opportunity to
play against our friends the Hawai‚Äôi Fridays, and were promptly eliminated from
the tournament. Despite this, we finally won a long awaited buff: Pitching Boost.
Magic ~~goo~~ vile!

In all this chaos, furgat, fellow Yellowstone Magic fan, did a great job and did
a nice theme for this site! We‚Äôve also had Sky writing a book report, the first
non-Blaseball related article! Let‚Äôs not forget Dharla Day and Virgo for the
summary of the first season! Thank you again for participating to the site!

I‚Äôve stated multiple times that this site isn‚Äôt my site, but ours. There are 3
other people set as owners of the
[yellowstone-magic organization on GitHub](https://github.com/yellowstone-magic)
to ensure that if I can‚Äôt/don‚Äôt want to maintain the site anymore, other people
can do it (albeit with some GitHub knowledge‚Ä¶).

This is an invitation: if you want to write *something* for the site, you‚Äôre
more than free to do so. There‚Äôs no clear guideline for content here, as long
as it‚Äôs somewhat related to the YSM community interests; and we have a LOT of
interests.

If you know about GitHub and/or Jekyll, you proably know how to do things: fork
the repository and create a pull request. Or you can ask me (trucy) to add you
as an owner of the organization, which will give you full access to the
repository.

If you don‚Äôt know about GitHub and/or Jekyll, you can still contribute! Just
send it as a DM to Catfish or me (which Catfish insists on calling it ‚Äústapling it on
the nearest mossy tree‚Äù). The formatting is similar to Discord‚Äôs formatting
(it‚Äôs markdown), but if you want a look üëÄ at what it looks like behind the
scenes, here are [Dharla Day and Virgo season 1 summary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yellowstone-magic/yellowstone-magic.github.io/main/_posts/2023-01-22-season-1-summary.markdown)
and [Sky‚Äôs book review](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yellowstone-magic/yellowstone-magic.github.io/main/_posts/2023-01-30-Sky-Book-Report.md) in their markdown format.

Please do not hesitate to ask for help! We‚Äôd be more than happy to help you!

Another thing: at first I‚Äôve called this ‚Äúwobsite‚Äù as a reference to this
XKCD comic:

![Caption at top of panel: My hobby: Mispronouncing words
 Cueball and a friend are talking: Cueball: Yeah, did you see what he said on his wobsite? Friend: ...his what? Cueball: Wobsite. Friend: ... I think you mean "website." Cueball: Why don't you write about it in your blag?](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/mispronouncing.png)

Naming things is important! As I‚Äôve stated before, I don‚Äôt want this to be
*my* website, deciding of its content, it‚Äôs an amalgam of our contributions.
That‚Äôs why I am renaming this to The YSM Grimoire. It sounds more magic, and
reflect more the fact that it‚Äôs a collection of stuffs. Will you add your page
to the grimoire? üëÅ

I‚Äôm **always** looking for stuff to add to the Grimoire, be it a summary of a
season, election results, a game day, a book report, some video game recommendation,
a thing you made‚Ä¶

With all of that said, I hope you had a good season, that you‚Äôll have a good
siesta, and I‚Äôll see you later on the Internets.
