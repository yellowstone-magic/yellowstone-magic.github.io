Title says all. Join the Pathfinder Society.

## What is the Pathfinder Society?

The Pathfinder Society is the organized play program for the Pathfinder 2nd edition
roleplaying game. It’s basically a worldwide campaign open to everyone! You can
play the same character with different parties and different GMs! No more
scheduling issues! Want to play? Join a table, any table! Want to GM but just for a session?
Please do! Want to be forever player/GM? You can!

## Wow, sounds neat, but I don’t know how to play Pathfinder

We all started somewhere. Fortunately, there are often beginner-friendly tables
set up! And honestly, if you played a d20 system at some point, you know how to
play. The main difference is that in encounters, characters have 3 actions (you
could move 3 times, or attack 3 times, or any other thing).

Never played a TTRPG (Table Top Role Playing Game) before? Pathfinder is pretty
easy to pick up! There might be a lot of stuff written, but everything is
explicit.

## OK, cool! But I don’t want to pay around 50 USD to play!

2 words: [Archives of Nethys](https://2e.aonprd.com/). It’s the official rules
reference, and it’s free and supported by Paizo, the publisher of Pathfinder! I
mean, there is literally the whole core rulebook [here](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx).

OK, fair enough, not all of it, you’re missing the sweet lore and art.

But it’s good enough to have a first idea of the rules, but I’d recommend you
join a beginner game!

## You’ve convinced me, let’s do this

Nice!

So let’s prepare you for a Pathfinder Society game. You need a Paizo account (ideally).
You can create one [here](https://paizo.com/organizedPlay/myAccount). Once it’s
done, you should have an Organized Play ID. Write it down!

That’s all.

## What about my *own* character?

Ah. With my instructions so far, you can play a [pregenerated character](https://paizo.com/products/btq01zt5?Community-Use-Package-PF2E-Iconics-Pregenerated-Characters). Just pick one, ask
your GM to give it to you, and you can play!

But OK, it’s normal, you want to play YOUR character. Make them evolve.
That’s the “hard part” of the Pathfinder Society.

Complete instructions can be found [here](https://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/Lorespire/pfs2guide._.Character%20Creation),
but in summary:

- Create a level 1 character
- You can only pick non-uncommon, non-rare, non-unique ancestries/backgrounds/classes
- You can only pick stuff from books you own (apart from Core Rulebook, Bestiary, and Lost Omens: World Guide)

About the 2nd rule, you can have access to uncommon or rare choices by
buying them with Achievement Points, which you get by playing in Pathfinder Society
games!

## When can we play?

It depends on you! I have several adventures pretty much ready to go, from
lolfunny oneshots, to shorts adventures, to a full-on adventure path (a campaign)!
I will be in the usual channels (Maincord, and the Magic TTRPG server (ask for the
link!)), asking for availabilities.

In practice, games usually happen on vocal, and we use a VTT software to manage
the encounters. I use [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) which is pretty
easy to use, and very streamlined for Pathfinder!

As usual, send me your questions, I’ll gladly answer them.

I hope to see you soon at one of my tables,

GM trucy
