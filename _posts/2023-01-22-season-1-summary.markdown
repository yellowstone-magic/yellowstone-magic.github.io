Thanks to Dharla Day for the summary of the 1st season of Blaseball, and to Virgo
for the reporting of the election results!

## Season 1 Notable Events

- Season 1 \[OLD\] veteran Inky Rutledge fell from the blackhole to try their arms at normal human batting. The team observes that they are devoid of guile and stealth.
- 2-star rookie Kiki Avci hit TWO grand slams, making her technically the grandslamingest non-ghost blaseball player of all time. She was also the OPS leader in the entire league, with an OPS of 1.235 for the season!
- 'Worst Pitcher' Pippin Carpenter decided to VIBE and earned not one but TWO shutouts, against both the üî• (0-8) and the üêÖ  (0-17) in a game against Sage Kuroki, resulting in us setting the record for the largest shutout.
- IMPROVE PITCHING AND DEFENSE (but our offense is incredible!)
- We scored the 3rd most runs of all teams in the regular season, and Kiki Avci and Demet Cabrera were both on the leaderboard for most homeruns in the midseason!
- Demet Cabrera also led the team in triple plays!
- We set the record for highest score gap in a 22-2 game agains the Millenials.
- We found ourself yet again in the most competitive division, in a nailbiter competition for a postseason slot against the garages that went all the way to the very last day of games.
- We had a great election, winning Wind Spirits to FINALLY IMPROVE OUR DEFENSE! Magic recorded 56,750 votes in total, making us one of the biggest total voting blocks in the league.

## Election Results

WE WON WIND SPRINTS! Our lineup has gained one star of defense and one star of running. We had 11% of the vote -- absolutely MASSIVE. GREAT JOB TEAM!!

The book was opened --

- Anastasia Isarobot, star pitcher of the Wild Wings, was incinerated.

- Terrell Bradley of the Spies was alternated.

- Zephyr McCloud of the Tigers was cursed and has the Can‚Äôt Lose modification.

- Simon Haley of the Moist Talkers was shadowed for Pixie Carberry and has the Knighted modification.

- Breckenridge...uhh...broke.

- The Spies also won Strike Zero and now have ‚ÄúStrike One‚Äù on their team page I‚Äôm scared handsha

There was an ominous announcement before election results. Go check the pins in ‚ú®parkpark to see if you missed it!

We are now in The Coronation Era of Blaseball...ominous.
