Hello Magic! My name is Sky, aka TheSkyDomain and today I have brought to you a…
#### *~ Book Recommendation Post ~*

What is the first thing you think of when I say the word, “Scythe”? If you think of the harvesting tool of corn, then alright. If you think of the harvesting tool of SOULS, now we are talking. Scythes are my favorite weapon of all time, even though they are not meant to be a weapon in the first place. Mainly popularized by depictions of the Grim Reaper, it is used for the harvesting of souls and makes it a great weapon due to the sharpness of the blade, which is heavily curved to be able to be used in tactical maneuvers and strategic placement of you and your enemy.

But why am I saying all this you ask? Why are you talking about scythes and not a book like you promised us? Why is the only door that enters and exits this room locked? All these are great questions dear viewer, in which I will answer at least one of them! (Hint: It's not the last one)

The book I am recommending to you is… Scythe by Neal Shusterman! Specifically the first book of the trilogy “Arc of a Scythe” series. This is a science fiction novel series, just to be warned, but lets go ahead and get into the summary you desperately need.

First off, it is needed to say this to set up the entire story: Humans cannot die. You read that right, we have finally conquered death at this time in the story. Diseases? Gone. Murder? Not a thought anymore. Old Age? Can literally be reset to any age you want to. How is this possible? Thanks to an overlord AI that controls everything and microbots within everyone of course!

Now now, before you get your pipes to smash things and EMPs, it is ok. This AI, also known as the Thunderhead, is actually a GOOD overlord AI with full control over everything. Crazy right? This thing actually has the capacity to interact with every specific person and simultaneously run the entire world all at once. It is loving, caring, and will always protect humans at all costs. If they were to get killed by any means, then the microbots within people’s systems will prevent this. 

Some high IQ readers must already be thinking, well then what about the overpopulation of the world? Without death, the population must skyrocket! Well, yes you are correct. But the Thunderhead thought of this of course.

Enter, Scythes. (Roll Credits) Scythes are the soul people able to make others die. They “glean” the population in order to prevent the overpopulation, deciding when someone were to die all on their own. Every Scythe gleans differently, whether it be based on statistics, if you just happen to be in an unlucky crowd that day, or even how you look. Scythes work directly under the Thunderhead itself. Scythes are respected and feared immensely, for they WILL be the last thing you see before you are to truly die. There is a set of commandments that every Scythe follows, which I will briefly go over.

1. Thou shalt kill. - Self explanatory.
2. Thou shalt kill with no bias, bigotry, or malice aforethought. - Scythes shall not kill with any personal matters.
3. Thou shalt grant an annum of immunity to the beloved of those who accept your coming, and to anyone else you deem worthy. - All members of a gleaned’s family are granted a year's worth of immunity from being gleaned themselves. This is done through a Scythe’s ring.
4. Thou shalt kill the beloved of those who resist. - If a person chosen to glean resists their death, Scythes kill their family as recompense.
5. Thou shalt serve humanity for the full span of thy days, and thy family shall have immunity as recompense for as long as you live. - You must always be a Scythe until you die, and since you are a Scythe your family will always have immunity.
6. Thou shalt lead an exemplary life in word and deed, and keep a journal of each and every day. - Be a role model to others, and keep a journal of your days.
7. Thou shalt not kill fellow scythes beyond thyself. - You are only allowed to glean yourself. 
8. Thou shalt claim no earthly possessions, save thy robes, ring, and journal. - Live frugally. 
9. Thou shalt have no spouse nor spawn. - You are not allowed to marry or have children.
10. Thou shalt be beholden to no laws beyond these. - No laws stop you except the ones as listed here.

Our two main characters, Citra and Rowan, are apprenticed under the renowned and respected Scythe Faraday, a job in which neither wants but is forced into anyways. They learn how to effectively glean and lead a Scythe’s life from him, but terror strikes partway throughout their apprenticeship, though thats something you will have to find out for yourself.

Neal Shusterman is well known for his worldbuilding and its most evident in this series. It is absolutely fascinating to daydream about as well as think of what kind of Scythe YOU would be. If this interests you I highly recommend it to you. If you like it, the are 2 other books in the series which just get better and better, and recently released was a spinoff mini-story collection (which I have not read yet). Let me know if you do end up reading it so I can gush about the characters with you! This was a lot of fun to write and I plan on making more in the future. Until then, keep on going with some mossy chill vibes and always remember that I would love to talk with you about anything you want! See you later for now though!
