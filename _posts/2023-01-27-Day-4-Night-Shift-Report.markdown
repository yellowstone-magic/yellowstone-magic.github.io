Howdy folks, and welcome to your final Night Shift report of the season, as we go to the post season in a matter of hours. At the time of writing Magic are still First in the division with a 52-23 record. Similarly to yesterdays report we begin with a series against the Tokyo Lift:

## YELL-TKO
### Day 76 - Horizon
- Tokyo started out the night shift getting on the board in the third inning, but Magic came back in the fourth
with Tokyo evening up the score! Things were still in play as the bases got loaded, and Katy Hermoso up to bat, Axel struck her out, ending the worry. Scoring three in the next inning the Magic just couldn't turn it around, only scoring two more in the 6th leaving the game at a **6-7**

#### Can't Lose Watch

- Zephyr McCloud moves to the Core Mechanics
- Jenkins Ingram remains with the Chicago Firefighters
- Özlem Suttner remains with the Miami Dale

### Day 77 - Horizon

- Duncan Phantom gets us first on the board this time around, but the Lift almost turn it back around; getting two players on second and third with no outs. Rat Mason shows up however, striking two out himself, with Kiki Avci catching the third. Not about to see a repeat of the previous game the team begin to wak up and go for it, scoring four points in very quick succession with Vernon Shotwell hitting a three run Homer.
- The Lift seem to rally though and get a *Four out Inning* in the 4th! But it was short lasted as Kiki and Vernon hit back to back home runs in the 5th

#### Can't Lose Watch

- Zephyr McCloud stays with the Mechs
- Jenkins Ingram defects to the Houston Spies
- Özlem Suttner sidles over to the Baltimore Crabs

#### In Other Games

### Day 78 - Solar Eclipse (Gold)

- With a home run in the second innings, Magic were off to a great start to the closing game of this series, but the Lift came back in response evening it, and then pulling ahead with another in the third. O'possum nrings it nack in the fourth only for Amos to sacrifice theirself so Abbott Wright and Stu Trololo could rack the points up. Kiki rounds out the inning with a point of her own, putting the scores to 6-3.
- The game was even until Witching Hour when Abbott and Amos made it home one after the other. The Lift achieved a small pull back in the seventh but the park was closed outm keaving the final score a happy **8-5**

## CDMX-YELL

### Day 79 - Horizon

- The powerful team of Jelly/Duncan provided two points in the first, but the Wings respond at the top of the second with two of their own! Not to be outdone we responded with another two points (courtesy of Amos' Moss and Kiki's Deliveries), before it was brought back to 3-4 in the third.
- As Magic took to the field in the bottom of the Third, **Leach Herman** crashes down to the field. Bewildered Demet shrugged and carried on play like nothing phased them. But clearly both sides were shaken as the momentum shown early game had gone and things remained static until the seventh when the Wings evened it up. Bolstered by that, they scored a final point and the game ended out **5-4**

#### Can't Lose Watch

- Jenkins Ingram Moves to the Steaks, teaming up with Zephyr McCloud!
- Özlem Suttner stays with the Crabs


#### In Other Games
