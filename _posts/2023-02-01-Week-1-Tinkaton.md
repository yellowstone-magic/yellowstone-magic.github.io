Hey, it is Sky, A.K.A. TheSkyDomain! Starting today and every week following, I am going to be writing a weekly column titled:

                                        ***|Pokémon of the Week|***

Pokémon is a great aspect of my life and overall online presence (if you have not noticed, my Discord profile picture is my own Umbreon character named Yoru!) I am very excited to write this column and I hope you all will be looking forwards to it! I *hope* to be able to write this every Wednesday but I am not going to limit myself as I am a busy college student after all, but I am sure I will usually have the time to do it! 
Anyways with the intro and formalities at the way (and if you somehow did not see the title) the **Pokémon of the Week** is....
...
**Tinkaton!**

## General Info
Debuting in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, Tinkaton *(also known as* ***Dekanuchan*** (**デカヌチャン**) *in Japanese)* is a Generation 9 Fairy/Steel type Pokémon from the Paldea Region, in which it's Pokédex number is #281, with its National Pokédex being #0959. It can only be obtained without trading by evolving it from Tinkatuff at level 38. It is also the final form of Tinkatuff's pre-evolution, Tinkatink. It will always be female. 
## Biological Features
Tinkaton's general appearance is described as:
"Tinkaton is a pink humanoid Pokémon, with large, white arms and short, stumpy toeless feet with light pink circles underneath. Tinkaton wields a crude, gigantic metal hammer that weighs over 220 pounds (100 kg) and is larger than its own body. The hammer appears to have been made using the old hammer Tinkaton had as a Tinkatuff for the base, with several scraps of metal colored in varying shades of gray and purple welded onto it. The hammer also has a spiked beige axe-like structure on top. Although the hammer is heavy, Tinkaton can swing it with ease by using its whole body. It has known to never be too far away from it's hammer, even known to sleep on it." - Credit to Bulbapedia

Its shiny form changes the color of it's hammer to be more brownish and tan colored then black and gray, most likely to show its hierarchy over the other non-shiny Tinkatons around it.

One interesting fact about Tinkatons is that they have a deep and utter hatred for Corviknights, a Pokémon introduced in Generation 8 in the Galar region in which they were used for air transport. Tinkatons have been documented swinging their hammer like a bat ***(BLASEBALL REFERENCE????)*** to send stones towards flying Corviknights. 
## Competitive Viability
Competitively,  Tinkaton's viability is mixed. Its overall base stats are low and the abilities it can have can be very lackluster, but its defense regarding its type advantages is stellar and it is the sole wielder of the "Gigaton Hammer" move, a 5 use move with a powerful base damage of **160**.
## Connection to the Yellowstone Magic
Many people within the Yellowstone Magic Maincord have mentioned the combability between Tinkaton and one... **Kiki Avci!**

Kiki Avci is a recent lineup addition to the team, new in this Coronation Era of Blaseball. Despite this, they have been an absolute fan favorite and always makes the ballpark roar with excitement when she steps up to the plate. Wielding her trusty broom, this witch sweeps the competition utterly and totally under the rug. 

They are definitely a star hitter within the Yellowstone Magic, known for getting us home run after home run. During Season 1, Game 23 Kiki was a top 3 home run scorer in the entire League at 10 runs that early in the season. As we say it on the Discord... ***Kiki Delivers***.

It is in this humble writer and Blasémon fan's (Coining the term now) opinion that Kiki would be the absolute perfect trainer of a Tinkaton. Both of them have definite gremlin energies and both swing for the birds in the sky. Even when one of them is actually *trying* to hit the birds. Besides on the field of play, both would be absolute powerhouses elsewhere, such as Yellowstone Parkpark upkeep, as well as getting out any... "unruly" intruders. 
## Outro
Thank you for reading the first Pokémon of the Week column! I had a *LOT* of fun writing this and it was something I poured a lot of my motivation into and it really helped me destress! 
To give one last gift before I leave here today, here is my artist's rendition of Kiki Avci and her Tinkaton! I want to try to do this each week so I can build more confidence with my art and also to really get the Blasémon art going! Thanks so much, and I will see you all next week for the next Pokémon of the Week! (Check out @Skybreon on Twitter for the image itself and my other art!)
