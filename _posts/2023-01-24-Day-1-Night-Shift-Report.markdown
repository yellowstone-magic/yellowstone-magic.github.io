# Season 2, night shift

Well folks, what a night it's been. We saw a lot, so let's get summarising! This reporter regrettably missed day 13, so we begin on day 14, midseries against the Worms:

## OHWO-YELL
### Day 14 - Solar Eclipse (Gold) 
- After a slow start the game heated up fast with the worms scoring 3 in the third, only for DeAndre O'Possum to turn it right back around on them, hitting a Grand Slam! This had the effect of rallying the team for the midgame, putting 7 points on the board in the 5th. Easing out the rest of the game bringing it to a close with a final score of **5-13**

#### In Other Games:

- Anathema Elemefayo was nearly cursed, but dodged it at the last second
- Shoe Thieves vs Tigers came to a close finish, at 4-4 going into the 13th inning the Tigers scored a winning point, with Adrian Melon hitting a home run, sending Zephyr McCloud back to the Tigers where they began. Nice loop there Z. Let's see if they can hold onto them in the next game.

### Day 15 - Solar Eclipse (Silver)
- The 4th inning threatened a repeat of Day 14, with blases loaded and O'Possum up to the plate it was not to be, especially with the Worms scoring 3 at the top of the 5th to take the lead. Maybe they're afraid of what O'Possum could do? It helped them do it though, as despite our best efforts the game finished out **6-5**

#### In Other Games:
- Sherbet Baek on the San Fransisco Lovers hit a Grand Slam at the bottom of the 9th, with the scores already 1-5 it was just hammering the point home to bring the game to a final score of **1-9**
- The Shoe Thieves went 5-0 early on, seemingly eager to reclaim Zephyr, and kept up the assault through the rest of the game, finishing on **10-5** and pulling McCloud back into their ranks.

## YELL-SEA

### Day 16 - Horizon

- The Garages were first on the board, keeping it at 0-4 for the longest time. But Amos Sikaeo came in clutch for the team with not one, but two Grand Slams in the 6th and 7th innings parading us to a **15-6** victory

#### In Other Games:

- Malin Hsu hit a Grand Slam for the worms in the 7th, helping them take and keep the lead on the Fridays: **3-6**
- Crabs/Tigers went to the 13th inning, Crabs scoring in the top and the Tigers missing out for a **2-1**
- Dale/Thieves ended with Zephyr staying on the Thieves, and the scores at **3-5**
