Night Shift clocking in, and boy is it going to be an interesting night, like all other nights! We currently have Zephyr McCloud, and Day 58 is going to be an interesting one, with the site reporting a massive *24* games in one day?!

***

## YELL-TKO
### Day 55 - Solar Eclipse (Red) 
- Tokyo were first out of the gate, with a three point home run from Roscoe Sundae, and two singles before Demet got a double out, all in the 1st inning alone! From their solid 0-5 start the Magic regained some ground, but the Lift managed to stay ahead of us for a respectable *7-9*

#### Can't Lose Watch

- Zephyr McCloud leaves the Magic and moves to the Lift
- Jenkins Ingram Remains with the LA Unlimited Tacos
- Özlem Suttner Remains with the Baltimore Crabs

#### In Other Games

-The Boston Flowers beat the Ohio Worms **17-0**. Phenomenal play!

## STANDARD ALERT

We in the reporters box have been informed that Day 58 is no longer going to be a *Doubleday* and instead the 24 games will be played across Day 58 and 59. We now return you to your scheduled Broadcast.

### Day 56 - Solar Eclipse (Silver)

- Another quiet start for both teams, with Magic getting close numerous times, before the Lift made it first on the board in the 3rd, with a home run from Verson Cotterpin. They slowly inched forward before we made it on the board with one point in the top of the seventh, only for the Lift to turn back around and score another 6 points in the bottom, keeping it there for a final score of **1-10**

#### Can't Lose Watch

- Zephyr McCloud Remains with the Lift
- Jenkins Ingram Remains with the LA Unlimited Tacos
- Özlem Suttner switches to the Miami Dale

#### In Other Games

- Steals Mondegreen from the Hades Tigers was incinerated. They are succeeded by Leandra Beech.

### Day 57 - Solar Eclipse (Blue)

- In the final game of the series and our last chance to regain Zephyr for the foreseeable future, this is a crucial game. But in the bottom of the first the Lift brought the power they've shown all series to begin with a quick two points. We rallied in the 3rd though, scoring four points in total, with Abbott hitting a double, letting Jelly and Demet score. The lead was short lived as the Lift evened it up at the bottom.

- Moving into the 5th, DeDe prove their power, as O'Possum lets Demet score a needed point, before Amos hits a Homer letting O'Possum get home too bringing us to a 7-4. In the closing innings of the game there was evidence of Stu Trololo having amazing legs, as he made it safe to third, as Abbott Wright got out on the same base! Ludicrous speed aside, the rest of the team brought home a resounding **10-5** win

#### Can't Lose Watch

- Zephyr McCloud returns to the Magic ~Oh yeah, Baybee!~
- Jenkins Ingram swaps to the Boston Flowers
- Özlem Suttner stays on the Dale

#### In Other Games

- ATL-MECH got up to a Maximum Blaseball in the bottom of the 5th, but the Mechs weren't able to capitulate upon it, not that they felt they needed to as the score at the time was 4-10. But as the game went on the Georgias climbed, and climbed, pulling even, and then ahead in the 8th! With an extra point in the 9th to finish out at a phenomenal **15-12**
- Stepanie Donaldson of the Jazz Hands dodges a Mage Umpires curse, but Jammy Decksetter of the Shoe Thieves was Alternated by one not long later

## YELL-CDMX

### Day 58 - Solar Eclipse (Red)

- We begin out inter-divisional heavy-weight fight with a solid two points in the first, and the Wings coming back with just a single. The status quo is maintained through the 8th, with both teams coming close so many times, only for it to end out as it began at **2-1**

#### Can't Lose Watch
- Zephyr McCloud stays on the Magic
- Jenkins Ingram stays with the Flowers
- Özlem Suttner stays with the Dale

#### In Other Games

- Ajax Murphy of the Worms avoided a Knight Umpires swear

### Day 59 - Solar Eclipse (Silver)

- With the Magic one point behind the Wings this game could ring us even in the standings, as we go into the 1st inning the players are reminded just how much this game matters. The Wings made it first onto the board in the 2nd, with Stu scoring in the 3rd, and Zephyr scoring a two point Home Run to bring us to 3-1. Kiki scored as Zephyr got out in the 5th. 

- The Wings pulled ahead with 5 points in the fifth, with three Home Runs. Magic began gaining in the 8th, with a two point Homer from Jelly. We scored two more in the 9th to be ahead by one, only for the Wings to even it up! It goes to the tenth inning, where the Wings pull out a shame, racking up two extra points finishing the game on a well fought **8-10** 

#### Can't Lose Watch
- Zephyr McCloud leaves and heads over to the Wings for the final game in the series
- Jenkins Ingram stays with the Flowers
- Özlem Suttner stays with the Dale

#### In Other Games

- ATL-STKS was an amazing game, with two Grand Slams from Daisuke Witless in the 3rd and 7th innings on top of a high scoring game already the final score sitting at a brilliant **12-8**

### Day 60

- We go into this game, facing Zephyr, hoping to win him back. A win here would also bring us back to one behind the Wings. In a mirror to the previous game the Wings are first on the board with one point, which they fiercely defend into the 5th where, with bases loaded, they score a single extra point. Witching hour is upon us and despite our best efforts we can't pull out a score, but we manage to lock down the park.

- O'Possum takes the plate and hits a Homer at the beginning of inning 7 to get us on the board, with Demet pulling out another in the ninth to tie it up! With two runners on the plate Kiki steps up and hits a Homer of their own, before Amos comes in clutch with another! Fitzgerald closes the park in the bottom of the ninth to finish us out with an amazing comeback score of **6-2**

#### Can't Lose Watch
- Zephyr McCloud comes back to the Magic again
- Jenkins Ingram stays with the Flowers
- Özlem Suttner leaves the Miami Dale and heads over to the Thieves, probably to see what the fuss is about

With a third of the season left to go, and all to play for this reporter is looking forward to seeing what happens in the coming day and a half. Hopes are high that Magic remain Goo, the league are collectively watching the Cant Lose, and the Atlantis Georgias have apparently risen from below and become Terrifying?
