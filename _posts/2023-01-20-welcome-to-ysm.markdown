Ain’t that neat, huh?

So yeah, it’s a fansite, a website, or a wobsite as I (trucy) like to call it.

It’s pretty empty for now, but the hardest part is to setup stuff, and we’ll be
multiple people to edit it!

It’s still a big WIP, but please, feel free to add your stone! Don’t be afraid :
1. your changes won’t automatically go to production
2. any happy little incidents can be reverted

Honestly, even a LOT could be said about what I’ve done so far. But *something*
is better than nothing, right?

Anyways, welcome, and remember:
