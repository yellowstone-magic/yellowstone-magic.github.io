## YELL-BOS
### Day 35 - Solar Eclipse (Silver) 
- A gentle start was interrupted with a hectic 3rd inning, where Kiki Avci hit a home run, Vernon got on second, before Jelly hit a Homer of their own. Not content with that, Abbot Wright went for a sacrifice in the 4th for another two points! An exciting start to my night shift watching, as the game ended **7-2**

### Day 37 - Solar Eclipse (Gold)

- With the betting odds 50/50 this is going to be a good game to watch! Magic got onto the board first, with the Beams evening it up with a home run in the second. We pulled ahead in the 3rd, only for the Beam to even in the 5th. The back and forth was broken in the 6th, and a final point in the 9th leaves a final score of **5-2**

#### Can't Lose Watch
- Jenkins has moved over to the Flowers
- Zephyr remains with the Thieves

### Day 38 - Solar Eclipse (Red)

- The Beams scored 5 right off the bat, picking up to a stellar 0-7 in the 4th. Magic managed to get 2 in the 5th, and slowly inched ever closer, trying to close the gap by the 9th inning but were unable to score that final point! The Beams won at a well fought **6-7**

#### Can't Lose Watch
- Jenkins moves to the Garages
- Zephyr moves to the Wings

### Day 39 - Horizon

- Magic got off to a great start, first on the board in the 2nd inning, but can Twooney keep that momentum going and break the series tie. Strong hits from Jelly and O'Possum in the 3rd, followed by Twooney striking three batters out in a row brings it to 4-0. Point after point in the 4th, and Twooney tries to keep them down, but a home run from Kajjala Aliyev prevents a shutout. The Beams fought well, scoring points inning after inning, but in a mirror of the last game is wasn't enough, leaving it a **9-6**

#### Can't Lose Watch

- Jenkins Ingram stays with the Seattle Garages
- Zephyr McCloud moves back to the Shoe Thieves

It's time for a snooze! As ends to night shift go that's a pretty definitive one, so I will leave it there. Next up is a Series against the Atlantis Georgias and I think that'll be a hard fight. 

All that remains is for me to thank you for reading this, remind you that you matter, <sup>also remind you to drink water</sup>, and have a good day!
